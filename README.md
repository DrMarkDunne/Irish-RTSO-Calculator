# Irish RTSO Calculator
This is a calculator for calculating the RTSO (Retention Tax on Share Options) owed to the Irish Revenue Commission based on the strike price, market value, and share count of a stock option.

## Getting Started
In order to use the Irish RTSO Calculator, you will need to have a working internet connection and web browser. Once the page is loaded, enter the strike price, market value, and share count of the stock option in the corresponding fields. Then click the Calculate button to generate the total income from the sale of the shares, gross profit, total RTSO owed on profit, and net profit.
